Fire rages all over the village as you slowly begin to regain consciousness. You are sitting upright with your back to a wooden pole, which appears to be all of what remains of the southern watchtower. You can still hear some faint dragon wails in the distance, but the main attack is over. The smell of burning wood fills your nostrils as you slowly start to get up off the ground.<br><br>
“Peter!, Alex!”, you call out in an effort to check where your fellow guardsmen are, though you do not get a reply. You fear the worst as you turn back to look at the ruin that is the watchtower. Thankfully, you were on the ground when the dragons attacked, allowing you to stay hidden from their movement-based vision.<br><br>
You feel a sudden panic as you realise that your sister Lou must still be in the main village, but you don’t want leave your fellow guardsmen and friends, Peter and Alex behind.. <br><br>
